# Brain-Tumour-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Brain is the regulatory unit in the human body. It controls the functions such as memory, vision, hearing, knowledge, personality, problem solving, etc. Many health organizations have recognized brain tumor as the second foremost dispute that causes a large number of human deaths all around the world. Identification of brain tumor at a premature stage offers an opportunity of effective medical treatment. There are various techniques to detect brain tumors or neoplasms. Brain tumor is the growth of abnormal cells in the brain some of which may lead to cancer. The usual method to detect brain tumors is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. From the MRI images information about the abnormal tissue growth in the brain is identified. When these algorithms are applied on the MRI images the prediction of brain tumor is done very fast and a higher accuracy helps in providing the treatment to the patients. Here, in our proposed work we detect the brain tumor with the help of deep learning algorithms. These predictions made using DL also helps the radiologist in making quick decisions.
